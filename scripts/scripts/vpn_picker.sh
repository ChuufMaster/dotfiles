# Commentary:

# This program uses rofi and nmcli to let the user enable/disable VPN
# connections.

# Code:

# What to show in front of an active VPN connection:
ACTIVE_PREFIX="  âœ“ "

# What to show in front of an inactive VPN connection:
INACTIVE_PREFIX="    "

# Display on standard output all VPN connections, one per line. An
# active VPN connection is prefixed with `ACTIVE_PREFIX` and an inactive
# one is prefixed with `INACTIVE_PREFIX`.
function list_vpn_connections() {
    nmcli --get-values ACTIVE,NAME,TYPE connection show \
        | grep ':vpn$' \
        | sed \
              -e "s/^no:/${INACTIVE_PREFIX}/" \
              -e "s/^yes:/${ACTIVE_PREFIX}/" \
              -e 's/:vpn$//'
}

# Take a line as displayed by `list_vpn_connections()` as argument and
# use nmcli to toggle the corresponding connection.

# connection name.
